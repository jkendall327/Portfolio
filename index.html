          <h3 class="business-header">Writing for Cafe Indie</h3>
          <p class="preface">Selections of material written for David Plumtree of Café INDIE, a Scunthorpe non-profit,
            on a volunteer basis. Our contact has resulted in ideas such as writing newsletters for the café’s
            currently unused mailing lists and blog posts which detailed their social philosophy and efforts in the
            local community.</p>
        </div>
        <article class="entry">
          <h4 class="item-header">Sample email newsletter</h4>
          <p>

        <article class="entry">
          <h4 class="item-header">‘What kind of place are we, anyway?’</h4>
          <p class="item">
            Here at Café INDIE, we’re proud to say that we’re the only non-profit co-op café in
            Scunthorpe -- but what does that actually mean? How do you stay open if you don’t make any profit? And
            isn’t a ‘co-op’ one of those corner shops? Don’t worry: you’re not alone. While we’ve all heard these terms
            before, it can be hard to understand what they actually mean in practice. Let’s cut past the jargon and
            explain in clear terms how we’re different from your typical high street shop.The ‘non-profit’ part is the
            simpler of the two.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            All it means is that of the money we get from selling drinks, food or event tickets, we
            only keep what we need to keep the Café’s doors open. Most businesses see these things as necessary evils,
            where the real reward is the money you get over and above that—the profit. We, however, use that money to
            fund charitable causes, fill out our event schedule for the upcoming months or invest in the local
            community.The outcome is that we’ll be using our business to help improve Scunthorpe’s town center and put
            our work towards a good cause.
          </p>

          <p class="item">
            Now the trickier part—what it means to be a co-operative business. As the
            name suggests, the point is that we’re all in it together: everybody who works at the café has at least some
            say in how we run things. We even let customers buy a stake in the business, which lets them have their own
            influence on the direction we take going forward. This applies to almost everything we do, from what food
            we serve to whether we offer alcohol, our opening times, and the events we put on.We don’t do this just for
            the sake of it, of course.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            Operating as a co-op helps us stay responsive to the needs of the community and
            our customers, since it stops any one of us from unilaterally laying down how we think things should be.
            We’ve always been firm in our belief that we’re accepting of everyone who walks through our doors, and
            giving the public at large the real opportunity to make their voices heard seemed to us the only reasonable
            way of put-ting our money where our mouths were, so to speak.
          </p>

          <p class="item">Hopefully, this short post has gone some way to making those words feel a bit more natural
            on your tongue. That said, the best way to really understand what we’re all about is to come over and say
            hi in person—don’t worry, there’s no quiz—so we hope to see you in the café some time soon!</p>

      <section class="smartwatches">
        <article class="entry">
          <h4 class="item-header">Smartwatches: what’s behind the hype?</h4>
          <p class="item">
            In the last five or ten years, when no-one was paying much attention, electronic life seems
            to have crept into all the everyday objects that inhabit our lives. We speak commands to AI assistants to
            control our smart homes and our smart fridges, even our smart coffee machines. This apparent explosion in
            intelligence, no doubt, has left more than a few people wondering if it’s just a fad. These things are
            convenient, sure, but it’s not like you need them, or so the argument goes.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            And while you shouldn’t jump
            on every consumer-electronics bandwagon out there, this wariness means that sometimes legitimately
            fantastic technologies get left by the wayside in the cultural conversation.I’m talking, of course, about
            the humble smartwatch, those strange, futuristic devices that canrun apps, monitor your heartbeat, solve
            complex equations and even—so my sources say—tell the time. Far too many people overlook the ways a
            mini-computer strapped to your wrist could tangibly make life easier, usually assuming out-of-hand that
            whatever a watch do, the phone already in their pocket can do better. Not so. Let’s detail some of the
            benefits to getting your own smartwatch.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            The most important benefit is perhaps also the most subtle. If you’ve ever worn an old ‘dumb’watch,
            you’ll likely know how quickly it becomes just a part of your body. Unlike a smartphone, which can
            oh-so-easily be misplaced, dropped, scratched, chipped or simply forgotten, a smartwatch stays a constant
            presence throughout your day—making sure you’re always plugged into what you need to get things done.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            Because of this, a smartwatch will also always be more discreet than other forms of technology. There’s
            some places where it’s just plain inappropriate to whip out your tablet—an important business meeting,
            say—but that’s no reason to be cut off from your equally important digital life.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s where this new wave of miniaturised technology shines: how many times have you thought twice about
            someone quickly
            glancing at their wrist?Similarly, smartwatches are utterly unmatched when it comes to versatility and
            fitness. The simple fact is that wherever you can go, they can go too, and so it’s not particularly
            surprising that the first smartwatch ‘boom’ was arguably among fitness enthusiasts who rightly recognised
            them as a way to bring the benefits of digital accounting to their workout regimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plenty of people
            around the world already use models like a Fitbit to track their vital statisticswhile running marathons,
            tackling treadmills, or even swimming laps. And outside of the gym, how about using a built-in camera to
            snap a photo of your lunch so an app can analyse exactly how many calories it’ll bring in? It’s not quite
            the science-fiction fantasy of having computer chips installed in your brain, but it’s pretty close.
          </p>
          <p>
            That increased focus of a smartwatch, too, brings its own inherent benefits. Namely, they’re excellent tools
            for increasing productivity and keeping you honest to what you know you should be doing, rather than
            bashing out just one more round of a Facebook wordsearch game on your phone. In one fluid motion, you can
            quickly check your appointments, make your calls, send your payments—and then move on. If you find your
            free time (and your not-supposed-to-be-free time) getting sucked into the vortex of electronic screens,
            the no-non-sense efficiency of a smartwatch might be just what you need to break free.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alright, that might
            be enough practical reasons for me to get away with finishing on a benefit that is, admittedly, pretty
            vain: modern smartwatches are just plain stylish. Analogue watches have been a key accoutrement in the
            fashion world over the decades, and the sleek, low-key design of these newer products continues that
            heritage with grace. You’ll definitely want to be colour-coordinating for black, but besides that,
            nowadays you can find a device in whatever shape and size best fits your ‘look’—or might even enhance it
            with a technological flair.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope that this brief overview of the state of smartwatches has helped dispel
            some of the vague, unfounded assumptions that plague these devices. They are, if nothing else, definitely
            not mere accessories or toys for those with disposable cash (they’re almost always more affordable than a
            proper phone, anyway). Instead, smartwatches have carved out a substantial
            niche for themselves in the lives of their users, where they are unarguably the dominant choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether
            you’re a fitness buff, a professional with no time to waste, or just a techie looking for new gear to
            tinker with, I highly recommend at least checking out some of the topwatches being sold today. You might
            not even realise how much you’ve been missing without one.

        <article class="entry"></article>
        <h4 class="item-header">The Best Apps for Supercharging your Japanese Study</h4>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered why, despite all the interminable hours you spent in Japanese study
          groups at college, you still mix up sudoku and seppuku? Are you an avid anime watcher, but still aren't
          sure where hiragana ends and katakana begins?Well, you're not alone. These two examples represent the two
          extreme ways of how not to learn a language. Study groups and formal courses are useful for theoretical
          knowledge, but are too infrequent and formalised to get a real grasp of a living language.
        </p>
        <p>
          And pure
          immersion in the target language—watching anime all day every day—might be fun, but without a the-oretical
          base of knowledge to support it, you won't get far.The solution is to bring serious language study out of
          the classroom and into your daily life. The best way to do that, as you might have guessed from the title
          of this post, is to use that magical black box in your pocket we call a smartphone. There's literally
          thousands of great free apps out there for learning Japanese, but for today let's just go overthree of
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. HelloTalk
        </p>
        <p>
          Easily the tool on this list that feels least like a language study tool, HelloTalk is a
          mobile-only social network designed exclusively for language learners. While you can use it for any
          language, its largest userbases are easily for English and Japanese. When you sign up, you simply mark
          yourself as wanting to learn Japanese and you'll automatically be given a feed of posts from native
          Japanese speakers—an endless stream of reading material to practice your skills on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, it comes
          with several features designed to make a learner's life just that little bit easier. You can request an
          automatic transcription or even translation of every post, saving you the trouble of looking up words you
          don't know, and when you're fixing other people's mistakes in English, you can actually edit their posts
          in-line to directly point out where they've gone wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Kanji Study
        </p>
        <p>
          Minor notice: this is the only paid
          app on this list, but it's included because it really is worth
          7the ten dollars it takes to unlock its full potential. This app includes a corpus of every main-stream
          kanji character, and a few thousand of the non-mainstream ones, too. While you can use it for simple
          things like character flashcards or testing how well you remember the mean-ing of a character, this
          program is most useful for its handwriting tests, where you have to trace out a prompted character to
          ensure you've memorised the correct stroke order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stroke order is often neglected by Japanese learners, but
          it's an essential way of making your writing legible and making characters feel distinct from one another.
          Kanji Study's accessible interface makes it incredibly easy to start blasting through hundreds of kanji,
          and its built-in ratings system gives you a constant incentive to improve your performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Japanese Dictionary
        </p>
        <p>
          OK, you knew there’d have to be at least one dictionary app, right? It's basically mandatory.
          But while this app has an unfortunately generic name that makes it a little hard to search up, it's my
          personal pick for the best E->J dictionary app out there.
        </p>
        <p>
          For one thing, it's fully offline,meaning you
          don't have to dip into your precious mobile data to check jisho.org when you're out in the wild. And
          beyond that, it comes with a built-in spaced-repetition-system (SRS) which you can directly add unknown
          words to, which makes memorising them a cinch.

          <h4 class="item-header">Sennheiser’s HD280pro headphones</h4>
          <p class="item">For the past sixty years, Sennheiser has been the top name in professional-grade audio
            equip-ment, continually pushing the boundaries of high-fidelity studio equipment in the name of technical
            prowess and engineering excellence. Our products are perfectly suited for the full spectrum of consumers,
            from the general public to the exacting professional, and as the most recent refinement of our technology
            the HD280 headphone series is sure to impress.</p>

          <p class="item">These headphones are made to be daily drivers, with a light
            collapsible frame and standard-ised I/O—no unwieldy loops of wires here—which means you can take them
            wherever your work goes. Our ergonomic, padded ear cups are now so delicate to the touch that within a few
            minutes, you’ll forget they’re even there, and the strong noise cancellation of the closed-ear design (up
            to 32 dB) ensures there’ll be absolutely no distractions from the outside world. In other words? Long
            nights in the studio just got much easier.</p>

          <p class="item">Sennheiser has always meant sterling quality, and the specs of
            the HD280s are more than up to par. With a frequency response of up to 250k Hz, dynamic range has never
            been easier to hear, and with total harmonic distortion pushed down to 0.1% of total signal width,
            there’ll be nothing between you and the sounds you’re focusing on.Retailing at £125 in the U.K., the
            HD280s are a reliable workhorse for the audio professional and a great introduction to ‘serious’ gear for
            the general consumer. Our designs emphasise value for money, so every component is easily replaceable,
            even down to the padding of the ear cups. Whether the perfect tool for the busy professional, or a great
            Christmas gift for a family music fan, rest assured that the HD280s will never fail to satisfy.</p> <br>

            There was a time in the Ancient Near East when the nomadic Hebrews lived in things called
            ‘tents’. In reality, this simple word belies a complex reality. We naturally assume they differed
            materially from our own small, mass-produced and vaguely triangular campsite shelters. But their meanings
            and significations also differed, in complex ways that do not shine through when compressed to a single
            word—indeed, no less than thirteen distinct nouns are used in the Hebrew bible to distinguish between
            tent-like structures (Homan, 7-15). They were the locus point for almost every strand of imaginable
            cultural activity, including the domestic, the
            9sexual and the agricultural (Negev and Gibson, 501).

            This essay will establish the tent as not just a
            material construction, but a literary construction intended by the authors of the Bible to affirm the
            Hebrew identity in response to the Babylonian exile and destruction of the first temple. Genesis is a book
            of etiology, meaning it attempts to explicitly and implicitly explain the origins behind things and
            practices. As such, a close-reading of two scenes—Abraham on the plains of Mamre and Esau selling his
            birthright to Jacob—serves as the best entry-point to considering the tent as a symbol for human
            civilisation, domesticity and transgression.

            Albert Camus' status as one of the most prominent French
            fiction-writers of the 20th centuryhas often obscured other major facets of his career, such as his
            lengthy stints as journalist for papers like Le Soir Républicain, Combat and L’Express. While many
            histories and collections of his journalistic work have been published, not many have brought them into
            direct dia-logue with his fiction.

            David Carroll sums up a general attitude in saying that though his
            journalism has “obvious historical and literary interest [...] their primary interest is above all
            political”. Jeanyves Guerin, too, describes an author moonlighting in the papers as a "way of earning a
            living"; something he came to enjoy but "did not accord [...] any priority". His fic-tion came first: "It
            was because he considered that Combat left him too little time to write La Peste that he began to take his
            distance from the newspaper in September 1945. And when hecame to leave L’Express, it was in order to
            finish La Chute".

            But such a view seems unneces-sarily dismissive. Though not present throughout his
            entire corpus, like Hemmingway’s fam-ously terse prose, influences from his experiences with the business
            of news can be clearly feltin Camus’ fiction.
