          <p class="preface">Selections of material written for David Plumtree of Café INDIE, a Scunthorpe non-profit,
            on a vo-lunteer basis. Our contact has resulted in ideas such as writing newsletters for the café’s
            currently-unused mailing lists and blog posts which detailed their social philosophy and efforts in the
            local community.</p>

          <h4 class="item-header">Sample email newsletter</h4>
          <p class="item">Hello, and thank you for signing up for the Café INDIE newsletter!Connecting with you is one
            of the most important things we do here, so we want this to be anexciting new way to keep you all up to date
            on where we’re at and what’s going on at the café.Speaking of which, be sure not to miss our next ‘Speak Out
            Scunny’ spoken word night on the 28th! We already have some excellent speakers lined up to share their
            poetry, their prose or just their thoughts—why not get up on stage and join them? We’re known for our
            wel-coming environment, so if you’re interested please do drop us an email at [...] to book your slot, as
            we’re sure you won’t regret it. Please note that while entry is free, performers are al-lotted five minutes

            roots with visits from some of the UK’s best music that’s yet to hit the mainstream, like Low Hummer,
            Fidelity Freak and Scunthorpe’s own The Nancys. </p>
            
            <p class="item">Entry at the door is only £4, so show up any time after

          <h4 class="item-header">‘What kind of place are we, anyway?’</h4>
          <p class="item">Here at Café INDIE, we’re proud to say that we’re the only non-profit co-op café in
            Scun-thorpe -- but what does that actually mean? How do you stay open if you don’t make any profit? And
            isn’t a ‘co-op’ one of those corner shops? Don’t worry: you’re not alone. While we’ve all heard these terms
            before, it can be hard to understand what they actually mean in practice. Let’s cut past the jargon and
            explain in clear terms how we’re different from your typical high street shop.The ‘non-profit’ part is the
            simpler of the two. All it means is that of the money we get from selling drinks, food or event tickets, we
            only keep what we need to keep the Café’s doors open. Most businesses see these things as necessary evils,
            where the real reward is the money you get over and above that—the profit. We, however, use that money to
            fund charitable causes, fill out our event schedule for the upcoming months or invest in the local
            community.The outcome is that we’ll be using our business to help improve Scunthorpe’s town center and put
            our work towards a good cause. </p>
            
            <p class="item"></p>Now the trickier part—what it means to be a co-op-erative business. As the
            name suggests, the point is that we’re all in it together: everybody who works at the café has at least some
            say in how we run things. We even let customers buy a stake in the business, which lets them have their own
            influence on the direction we take go-ing forward. This applies to almost everything we do, from what food
            we serve to whether we offer alcohol, our opening times, and the events we put on.We don’t do this just for
            the sake of it, of course. Operating as a co-op helps us stay respons-ive to the needs of the community and
            our customers, since it stops any one of us from uni-laterally laying down how we think things should be.
            We’ve always been firm in our belief that we’re accepting of everyone who walks through our doors, and
            giving the public at large the real opportunity to make their voices heard seemed to us the only reasonable
            way of put-ting our money where our mouths were, so to speak.</p>
            
            <p class="item"></p>Hopefully, this short post has gone some way to making those words feel a bit more natural on your tongue. That said, the best way to really understand what we’re all about is to come over and say
            hi in person—don’t worry, there’s no quiz—so we hope to see you in the café some time soon!</p>
